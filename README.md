This is(was) a simulator program for a coding competition, in which agents move around in a toroidal grid world.
Inside the main folder there are three things: simulator.py, Strategies, and Log.

If you want your strategy code to battle with te preexisting ones,
add a folder with your code in it inside the Strategies folder and append to the name list in simulator.py.

The Log folder is currently unused, and the code only uses it when saving the previous map for a post-simulation renderer, which I haven't implemented yet.
More exact instructions on what you can do with this simulator will soon be provided as comments in simulator.py itself,
since I feel like that would make modification easier for the user.
