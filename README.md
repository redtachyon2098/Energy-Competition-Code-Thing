Welcome to the documentation of this game!
This is the code for a competition game, where players create code which controls agents in a simulated environment, with the goal of surviving for a set amount of time.
Before explaining how to use the program, I'll explain the detail behind the game mechanics.
1. The world is finite yet toroidal, by which I mean that there is no "world border". If you go too far to the right, you'll wrap around the world and appear on the other side.
2. The world is a grid. Each grid point can be one of four different "biomes": Desert(ID:1), Grass(ID:2), Jungle(ID:3) and Mountain(ID:4). There's also the occasional Oasis(ID:0). Biomes also have a constant "drain value" (Oasis: 0.4, Desert: 0.6, Grass: 0.5, Jungle: 0.6, Mountain: 0.6) and a "radius value" (Oasis: 3, Desert: 3, Grass: 4, Jungle: 3, Mountain: 2).
3. Players move by submitting a vector coordinate every game tick. It is clipped with the biome radius value of the grid point the player is on, and gets added to their current coordinate.
4. Players have a value called their "energy". Various actions can change this value(Decrease: Moving around(length of vector coordinate, raised to the power of twice the drain value), Chasing(Same as moving, will be explained later), Splitting(halves your energy). Increase: Consumption of foliage and players(If successful, 90% of the "prey"'s energy.)). If the energy becomes equal to or under zero, the player is considered dead and is eliminated from the game.
