This is(was) a simulator program for a coding competition, in which agents move around in a toroidal grid world.
Inside the main folder there are three things: simulator.py, Strategies, and Log.

If you want your strategy code to battle with te preexisting ones,
add a folder with your code in it inside the Strategies folder and append to the name list in simulator.py.

The Log folder stores data from a previous run, which includes the image of the map along with a binary file containing player data.

More exact instructions on what you can do with this simulator will soon be provided as comments in simulator.py itself,
since I feel like that would make modification easier for the user.
